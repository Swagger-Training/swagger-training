# CRUD Operations

## Implement CRUD Operations for Policy Object

1. Create a `post` operation on the `/policies` resource, that creates a new
policy.
2. Create a `get` operation on the `/policies/{policyId}` resource, that gets
a specific policy.
3. Create a `put` operation on the `/policies/{policyId}` resource, that updates
or creates a policy.
3. Create a `delete` operation on the `/policies/{policyId}` resource, that
deletes a policy.

Try to reuse object definitions in your operations.

# Test

Validate `policies-api.yaml` specification in
[Swagger Editor](https://swagger-training.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/swagger-editor/index.html).
